# Photo-and-Video-Booth
Python based photo and video booth aimed at running on a Raspberry Pi 3 using a Logitech HD Pro Webcam C920.  Photographs upload to a self hosted Lychee server (plus local copy) and video is output to YouTube, Twitch or similar online service.

Originally written and successfully used for my wedding in February 2019.

Code is very rough but hopefully people have some ideas on how to make it easier to manage the system - possibly a web based interface to change settings quickly for non coders.
